In 2020 I completed the "Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!" Udemy course
by Jonas Schmedtmann. An incredible course that significantly improved my knowledge of CSS and made me
independent from tools like Bootstrap.

With such great courses I like to come back to them, and I found some extra time to do exactly that.
Rebuilding all the course projects and adding comments enabled me to remind myself of how powerful CSS is.

A lot of the things people use JS for can be built with pure CSS.
